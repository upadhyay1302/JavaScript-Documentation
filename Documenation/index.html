            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                        clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                        server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                        another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                        server.
                    </li>

            <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                    to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <section id="Hello_world">
            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
                your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
            </article>
        </section>
        <section id="Variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                    The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
                    rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                    dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                    Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                    "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                    (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                    identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                    characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                    Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <section id="Functions">
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task.
                    They are reusable and can be called multiple times within a program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can
                    be passed around like any other value. They can be assigned to
                    variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:
                    <code>
              function add(a, b) {
                return a + b;
              }
            </code>
                </p>

        <section id="Loops">
            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain
                    condition is met. JavaScript supports various types of loops:
                    <code>for</code> <code>while</code> <code>do...while</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>For Loop</h3>
                The for loop is commonly used for iterating over arrays
                or a fixed number of times. Here's an example:
                <code>
              for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                console.log(i);
              }
            </code>
                </p>
                <h3>While Loop</h3>
                <p>
                    The while loop executes a block of code while a specified
                    condition is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It consists of a condition and a code block. The condition is evaluated
                    before executing the code block.
                </p>
                <code>
      while (condition) { <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;// code block to be executed <br />
      }
    </code>

                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop:</p>
                <code>
      let i = 1; <br />
      while (i <= 5) { <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(i); <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;i++; <br />
      }
    </code>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Do-While Loop</h3>
                <p>
                    The do-while loop executes a block of code at least once,
                    and then repeatedly executes it while a specified condition is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It consists of a code block followed by the do keyword and
                    the condition.
                </p>
                <code>
      do { 
        // code block to be executed 
      } while (condition);
    </code>

                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Prompting the user for a valid number between 1 and 10:</p>
                <code>
      let number; 
      do { 
        number = prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 10:"); 
      } while (number < 1 || number > 10); 
      console.log("Valid number entered:", number);

        <article>
          <p>
            Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs used to store
            various data types and more complex entities.
